<p style="text-align: center;">
The Molecular Fisheries Laboratory is a resource for the sustainable harvest of wild fisheries and the conservation of marine species with scientific research outcomes utilising genetic and genomic tools.\n
The majority of the labs projects have focussed on species harvested (or impacted) by fisheries in Australia and other nations in the southern hemisphere. Species include molluscs, crustaceans, bony fish, sharks and rays.\n
Through our research, we aim to provide crucial insights into marine conservation, sustainable fisheries management, and marine ecosystems.
